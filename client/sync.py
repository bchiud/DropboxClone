"""The sync engine: reconcile a local folder with the server via delta sync.

push()  local -> server : chunk each changed file, upload only the blocks the
                          server is missing (straight to B2), then commit the recipe.
pull()  server -> local : fetch the recipe, download its blocks (straight from B2,
                          re-verifying each), reassemble.

Only changed *blocks* cross the network, and file bytes never pass through the
app server — they go directly to/from object storage via presigned URLs.

Conflicts: when both sides edited a file, neither edit is lost. pull never
overwrites a local edit that push() hasn't sent yet, and saves the server's version
as a "(conflicted copy)" beside it; push's 412 reconcile does the same before
retrying over the server's version. The next push uploads the copy.

Deletes sync both ways through LocalIndex (the last-synced state): a path in the
index but gone from disk was deleted locally, so push deletes it on the server; a
path in the index but gone from the server was deleted remotely, so pull deletes the
local copy unless it has an unpushed edit (which then survives as a new file). An
edit made elsewhere wins over a local delete that push hasn't sent yet.

Limitations (v1): pull downloads a differing file's blocks in full (no local
block reuse); a delete that push HAS sent wins over a concurrent edit elsewhere
(the server's DELETE takes no If-Match).
