# Dropbox Clone

A content-addressed file storage & sync system, built as a learning project.
It has two parts: a **FastAPI server** that stores files as hash-addressed blocks,
and a **sync client** — a folder-watching daemon that pushes/pulls changes, like
the Dropbox desktop app.

- **Server API:** FastAPI (Python 3.12)
- **Blocks:** Backblaze B2 (S3-compatible)
- **Metadata:** MongoDB Atlas
- **Auth:** JWT (HS256) + bcrypt
- **Client:** watchdog folder watcher + httpx

---

## Core idea: content-addressed storage

Every file is split into fixed-size blocks (4 MiB). Each block is stored under
the **SHA-256 hash of its contents** — the key *is* the hash. A file is then just
an ordered list of block hashes (its "recipe"), stored as metadata.

```
file bytes ──chunk──▶ [block, block, block]
                         │      │      │
                       sha256 sha256 sha256
                         ▼      ▼      ▼
   recipe:  ["3af…", "9c1…", "70b…"]     ← stored in MongoDB
   blocks:  key=<owner>/<hash> → bytes   ← stored in B2
```

This buys three things:

- **Deduplication** — identical blocks are stored once **per user** (see scoping below).
- **Delta sync** — editing part of a file only transfers the changed blocks.
- **Integrity** — a block's key is a checksum of its contents; readers re-verify it.

**Per-user block scoping.** Block keys are namespaced by owner (`<owner>/<hash>`),
derived from the authenticated token — never from client input. It's what makes
client-driven direct uploads safe, trading cross-user dedup for two guarantees:

- **No cross-user side channel** — `/blocks/missing` can only answer "do *you*
  have this block?", so your upload speed can't reveal whether *another* user
  already holds one.
- **No cross-user poisoning** — the server mints a presigned PUT and never sees
  the bytes, so it can't check `sha256(data) == hash` on write. Namespacing the
  key means a bad block can only ever land in your own namespace.

> Chunking is **fixed-size** (like Dropbox). The `chunker.split()` seam is isolated
> so it can be swapped for content-defined chunking (rolling hash) without
> touching any other layer.

## Architecture

Hexagonal (ports & adapters) with dependency injection. Dependencies point
**inward**: the outer layers depend on the inner ones, never the reverse.

   └──────────────────────────────┘        client → B2, bypassing every layer above

   composition root: dependencies.py wires adapters → services
   cross-cutting:    auth_dependencies.py (bearer → user) · realtime.py (Notifier + ConnectionManager)
```

**Why this shape:**

- **No framework leakage** — the domain and application layers never import
  FastAPI, boto3, or pymongo.
- **Swappable infrastructure** — trade B2 for local disk, or Mongo for Postgres,
  by writing one new adapter and changing one line in `dependencies.py`. Nothing
  else moves.
- **Testable core** — services are unit-tested with in-memory fakes, no cloud
  required.

**Realtime path (pub/sub).** A commit/delete publishes onto a `ChangeBus`; every
server runs a subscribe-loop that fans out to *its own* WebSockets — so a change on
one server reaches a device connected to any other. The bus is a port: Redis in
production, in-process when `REDIS_URL` is unset.

```
   any change ─▶ Notifier.notify(user) ─▶ ChangeBus.publish(user)
                                                    │  Redis pub/sub

                             │                                              │
                    Alice's sockets ✔                            (holds none) no-op
```

#### Why WebSockets — and why SSE was the closer call

The traffic is one-way and single-event: the server pushes `{"type":"changed"}`,
the client refetches. Nothing ever flows client→server on that socket. That is
**exactly** Server-Sent Events' shape, so the two were weighed:

|                            | WebSocket (chosen)                                        | SSE (`EventSource`)                                                                    |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fits one-way traffic**   | over-spec'd — bidirectional + binary framing unused       | purpose-built                                                                          |
| **Reconnect on drop**      | hand-rolled (exponential backoff, jitter, disposal guard) | free, built into the browser                                                           |
| **Missed-event replay**    | none — reconnect refetches instead                        | `Last-Event-ID`, if the server retains events                                          |
| **Auth**                   | no custom headers → token in query string                 | *same* — `EventSource` can't set headers either                                        |
| **Server (FastAPI)**       | first-class: `@app.websocket`, `WebSocketDisconnect`      | `StreamingResponse` + manual `text/event-stream` framing + `is_disconnected()` polling |
| **Connections per origin** | not subject to the HTTP/1.1 limit                         | consumes one of ~6 (moot here: ≤2 streams, and block transfers hit B2's origin)        |

- **Reconnect had to be hand-rolled** — `EventSource` ships with it. The strongest
  argument that SSE was the better fit.
- **Replay isn't wanted anyway.** `Last-Event-ID` needs retained events (Redis
  **Streams**, not pub/sub). Refetching on reconnect reconciles against current
  state — strictly stronger, and the payload is empty regardless.
- **Why the server side is simpler.** The traffic is one-way (SSE's shape), but the
  *plumbing* — upgrade, framing, liveness, teardown — is what FastAPI automates for
  WebSockets and leaves manual for SSE. The handler is ~20 lines of logic
  (`accept`, then `await receive_text()` whose only job is to raise
  `WebSocketDisconnect` on drop, then `finally` teardown); the SSE equivalent is
  that plus a hand-rolled `text/event-stream` generator with its own
  `is_disconnected()` polling.

**Verdict:** close call, and SSE is the better-matched primitive. WebSockets stay
because the server side is genuinely simpler in FastAPI and the reconnect is now
written and tested.

## Data models

Documents are schemaless in Mongo, so the schema lives in code as Pydantic models.
Adapters translate model ⇄ dict at the storage boundary (`.model_dump()` /
`Model(**doc)`); raw dicts never leak past the adapter.

A `├──` below means *inherits from*. The sharing models have no common base — each
is a standalone `BaseModel`, so they're listed flat, request body under the thing
it creates.

```
FileBase(owner, path, size, updated_at)
 ├── FileSummary(+ etag)                             # listing view (no recipe)
 └── FileRecord(+ block_hashes, etag)                # full stored document

UserBase(username)
 ├── User(+ password_hash, created_at)               # internal — never returned by a route
 ├── UserRegisterRequest(+ password)                 # request body
 └── UserRegisterResponse(+ created_at)              # safe response (no hash)

Share(owner, path, shared_with, created_at)          # one user-to-user grant (Mongo `shares`)
ShareRequest(path, shared_with)                      #   → its grant/revoke request body

ShareLink(jti, owner, path, created_at, expires_at)  # one live public link (Mongo `share_links`)
ShareLinkRequest(path)                               #   → its mint request body
```

- **`FileSummary` vs `FileRecord`** — a deliberate read/write split: listings
  project away the (potentially huge) `block_hashes` array but keep the `etag`, so a
  client can commit an update straight off the list without a recipe round-trip.
- **`Share`** — keyed on the `(owner, path, shared_with)` triple, one document
  per grant.
- **`ShareLink`** — keyed on `jti` (the token's unique id). Its *existence* is
  what makes a link live, so revoking is just deleting the row; `expires_at`
  mirrors the token's `exp` claim (both set once, at mint).

### Why NoSQL (MongoDB) over SQL

The access pattern drove this, not the data volume:

- **No joins to give up.** Every query in `app/adapters/` is a single-collection
  point lookup — `files` by `(owner, path)`, `share_links` by `jti`, `users` by
  `username`. Not one join, aggregation, or transaction in the codebase.
- **Recipes embed naturally.** `block_hashes` is an ordered array (~12,000 entries
  for a 50 GB file) stored inline in `FileRecord`, so a recipe read is one lookup.
  SQL wants a child `file_blocks` table, joined and re-sorted on every read.
- **Pydantic is already the schema.** `.model_dump()` / `Model(**doc)` at the adapter
  boundary *is* the whole ORM — no migrations, no second schema to keep in sync.
- **TTL indexes reap expiring rows for free** (`expires_at, expireAfterSeconds=0` on
  `refresh_tokens` and `share_links`) — no cron job. Postgres needs `pg_cron` or a
  sweeper.
- **Shard on `owner`** to scale out — a user's files and grants colocate (see
  [Scaling](#scaling)).

**The cost — referential integrity.** Nothing here *requires* NoSQL; Postgres would
serve this data fine.

- **What we gave up.** The cascade on delete is hand-rolled (`purge_for_file`) and
  non-atomic — an invariant the application layer must remember, not one the store
  enforces. Grant a share on a path that doesn't exist and it's silently accepted.
- **But `ON DELETE CASCADE` is only half a fix.** A foreign key on the *natural* key
  `(owner, path)` clears the rows, then happily resurrects them: delete
  `/report.pdf`, commit a new one at the same path, and the old grants reattach.
- **Identity is the bug; the database is a side issue.** The durable fix is an
  immutable surrogate `file_id` minted at first commit — which SQL gives you by
  convention, not by nature. See [Sharing tradeoffs](#sharing--permissions).

## API

All `/files` and `/blocks` routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
`owner` is always taken from the token, never from the request.

**Auth**

| Method | Path             | Body                        | Returns                        |
|--------|------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `POST` | `/auth/register` | JSON `{username, password}` | `201` `{username, created_at}` |
| `POST` | `/auth/login`    | form `username, password`   | `{access_token, token_type}`   |

**Delta flow** (used by the sync client — file bytes go directly to/from B2)

| Method | Path                                 | Body                         | Returns                                                |
|--------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `POST` | `/blocks/missing`                    | `{hashes: [...]}`            | `{missing: [...]}` — which blocks the server needs     |
| `POST` | `/blocks/upload-urls`                | `{hashes: [...]}`            | `{urls: {hash: presigned PUT url}}`                    |
| `POST` | `/blocks/download-urls?path=…&owner=` | `{hashes: [...]}`           | `{urls: {hash: presigned GET url}}` · `404` for a hash outside the file's recipe |
| `POST` | `/files/commit`                      | `{path, size, block_hashes}` | `201`/`200` `{path, size, blocks}` + `ETag` · `409` blocks missing · `412` stale precondition · `428` no precondition |
| `GET`  | `/files/recipe?path=…&owner=…`       | —                            | `{path, size, block_hashes}` + `ETag` header          |
| `GET`  | `/files`                             | —                            | `{files: [FileSummary]}` (each carries its `etag`)    |

On reads, `owner` is **optional** and defaults to the caller. Passing another
user's `owner` reads a file **shared with you** — the server gates it on a grant
and returns `404` (never `403`) if you have none. `path` is **required**:
`download-urls` presigns only hashes that belong to that file's recipe, so a
read authorized for one `(owner, path)` can't be used to pull other blocks in the
owner's namespace. A requested hash outside the recipe returns `404` — same
opaque answer as any other denial.

**Concurrent writes — optimistic concurrency on `commit`.** Every file carries an
`etag = sha256(ordered block_hashes)`, returned as an HTTP `ETag` on `recipe`,
`commit`, and each `/files` summary. `commit` is a **conditional write** keyed on
the etag the client last read:

- **`If-Match: "<etag>"`** — update this file *only if* it's still at that etag.
  A racing writer that moved it on gets **`412 Precondition Failed`**.
- **`If-None-Match: *`** — create only if the path is free; **`412`** if taken.
- **neither** — **`428 Precondition Required`**; the client must declare intent.
- A create returns **`201`**, an update **`200`**; both echo the new `ETag`.

The write is a single-document compare-and-swap in Mongo (`replace_one` filtered on
the etag), so it's atomic with no transaction. Re-committing identical content — a
retry or two clients making the *same* edit — folds into a no-op rather than a
false conflict. On a real `412` the client refetches, reconciles, and retries; the
policy differs by client (headless sync auto-retries last-writer-wins, the browser
prompts the user).

**Sharing** (read-only grants; `owner` is always the caller's token identity)

### Request flow — delta upload (bytes never touch the app server)

```
1. client: blocks = chunker.split(data)            # hashes computed client-side
2. POST /blocks/missing {hashes}      → server: BlockIndex.present_subset(owner) → missing[]   (one query)
3. POST /blocks/upload-urls {missing} → server: presigned PUT url per owner/hash
4. client → PUT block bytes → B2 directly           (only the missing blocks)
5. POST /files/commit {path,size,hashes} + If-Match/If-None-Match
                                          → server HEADs only the not-yet-indexed blocks in B2,
                                            indexes them, CAS on etag, saves FileRecord, returns new
                                            ETag (409 if a new block is absent, 412 on a stale precondition)
```

**The block index — a Mongo cache of "which blocks an owner has."** Negotiation
(`/blocks/missing`) is a single indexed query, not one B2 `HEAD` per hash — a 12k-block
file was 12k serial round-trips. The index is a strict **subset of B2**: a block is
recorded only *after* `commit` confirms it's really in B2 (bytes go client→B2 directly,
so the server can't trust the upload landed). That direction is the safety property —
the index can only ever *over*-report "missing" (→ a harmless idempotent re-upload),
never claim a block is present when it isn't (→ a committable-but-unreadable file). So
`commit` `HEAD`s only genuinely-new blocks (paid once, per distinct block), and the hot
negotiation path touches Mongo alone.

### Request flow — delta download

```
1. GET /files/recipe?path=…          → server: FileRecord.block_hashes
2. POST /blocks/download-urls {h}    → server: presigned GET url per owner/hash
3. client → GET each block → B2 directly, re-verify sha256(block)==hash, reassemble
```

## Authentication

- **Passwords:** bcrypt with a per-password random salt. Only the hash is stored.
- **Tokens:** JWT (HS256), signed with `JWT_SECRET`, with an `exp` claim. The
  `sub` claim carries the username.
- **`get_current_user`** decodes the bearer token on each protected request and
  returns the username, or raises `401` for a missing / invalid / expired token.
- **No user enumeration:** unknown-username and wrong-password both return the
  same generic `401` on login.
- **No hash leakage:** routes return `UserRegisterResponse`, never the `User` model.

---

## Sharing & permissions

Read-only sharing comes in **two independent flavors**, but both rest on one
insight: **sharing never touches `FileService`.** It's a thin *authorization*
layer that only decides **which owner's namespace** a read resolves to. The
per-user block scoping does the rest — a recipient reads the owner's
`<owner>/<hash>` blocks but can never write into them, so "read-only" falls out
as *less code* (there is no `can_write`).

| **Revoke**      | `DELETE /shares`                                                  | `DELETE /shares/link/{jti}` (deletes the row)                                                                        |
| **Expiry**      | — (grants are durable)                                            | `exp` claim, default 7 days (`SHARE_LINK_EXPIRE_MINUTES`)                                                            |

**Security invariants:**

- **`owner` on any mint/write comes from the token, never the body** — you can
  only share or link files you actually own.
- **`404`, never `403`, on denial** — refusing access never reveals that the
  file exists.
- **A read is scoped to one file's blocks, not the owner's whole namespace.**
  `can_read` / `resolve_link` authorize a `(owner, path)`, and `download-urls`
  presigns only hashes that appear in *that* file's recipe. Authz is on the path;
  the block hash alone is never a bearer capability — a grant on one file can't be
  turned into GET URLs for unrelated blocks in the owner's namespace. Out-of-recipe
  hashes get the same opaque `404`.
- **Auth and share tokens are non-interchangeable.** Both are HS256-signed with
  the same `JWT_SECRET`, so a `typ: "share"` claim (checked on decode) stops an
  auth token from being redeemed as a link, or vice-versa.
- **A share link carries no user.** The token *is* the capability: whoever holds
  `?token=…` may read exactly one `(owner, path)`, read-only, with no account.
- **Links expire and are revocable.** Two independent kill-switches, both checked
  on every read by `resolve_link`:
    - **Expiry** is free and offline — the `exp` claim is set once at mint (default
      7 days, `SHARE_LINK_EXPIRE_MINUTES`) and enforced by JWT decode, so an expired
      token fails signature-check before any DB lookup.
    - **Revocation** is an *allowlist*: minting writes a `share_links` row keyed on
      the token's `jti`, and a read only resolves while that row exists. `DELETE
    /shares/link/{jti}` deletes it — killing the link even though the signed token
      itself is still cryptographically valid. The same row powers `GET /shares/link`
      (list your live links). Revoke is **owner-scoped** (`{owner, jti}` filter), so
      no one can revoke a link they didn't mint.

**Revocation stops future reads, not bytes already in flight.**

- **What it kills.** `DELETE /shares` and `DELETE /shares/link/{jti}` take effect on
  the next `can_read` / `resolve_link`.
- **What it can't.** A presigned URL already handed out. B2 has never heard of the
  `shares` collection, so a recipient who fetched download URLs just before you
  revoked keeps them until those URLs expire.
- **How long.** `s3_url_ttl_seconds` (default **300**) bounds the window. It used to
  be an hour.
- **Why a window exists at all.** The same presigned direct-to-B2 transfer that keeps
  file bytes off the app server. The floor is set by the slowest legitimate download:
  `download_urls` signs a whole recipe at once and the client walks the blocks
  sequentially, so the TTL must outlast the entire transfer — at 4 MiB blocks and
  1 MB/s that's ~300 MB before the last URL goes stale. Minting URLs in batches as
  the client walks the recipe would decouple the two.

The `exp` claim and the row's `expires_at` are a **single source of truth** —
both computed once in `create_link`, so the JWT and the DB can never disagree.
A **TTL index** on `share_links.expires_at` reaps dead rows within about a minute
of expiry. It reclaims storage, not authority: `resolve_link` already rejects on
the `exp` claim, so the lagging row was inert before Mongo swept it.

**Tradeoffs (v1):**

- **Granting a nonexistent path** is silently accepted, creating a dangling grant
  that resolves to `404` on access.
- **Deleting a file purges its grants — but not atomically.** `DELETE /files` runs
  `purge_for_file` **before** `delete_file`. Purge-first fails safe: with no
  cross-collection transaction, a crash between the writes leaves a live file with
  no grants (recoverable), never a dead path with live grants (which would reattach
  on re-upload). `scripts/audit_storage.py --orphan-grants` reaps whatever the
  window leaves; closing it for good needs an immutable `file_id`.

## Sync client

A separate program (`client/`) that keeps a local folder in sync with the server —
the desktop-Dropbox piece. It talks **only** to the REST API and imports nothing
from `app/`, so a clean API is its entire contract. It does **delta sync**: it
chunks files itself and transfers only changed blocks, straight to/from B2.

```
file change      ──▶ watcher     ──▶ SyncEngine.push()   chunk → /blocks/missing → PUT missing → /files/commit
server "changed" ──▶ ws_listener ──▶ SyncEngine.pull()   /files/recipe → GET blocks (verify) → reassemble
```

- **`chunker`** splits files into hash-addressed blocks (its own copy of the 4 MiB
  scheme — the block hash is the shared contract with the server).
- **`LocalIndex`** remembers, per file, its last-synced content hash **and the
  server's etag** (persisted **outside** the synced folder), so `push` skips
  unchanged files without touching the network and knows the base etag for its next
  commit.
- **`push`** uploads only the blocks the server reports `missing`, then commits the
  recipe with `If-Match: <stored etag>` (or `If-None-Match: *` for a new file). On a
  `412`, `_reconcile` refetches the current etag and retries once — last-writer-wins.
- **`pull`** downloads a differing file's blocks from B2, **re-verifies** each
  (`sha256(block) == hash`) before reassembling — so a corrupt/poisoned block can
  never silently corrupt a file.
- **`watcher`** (watchdog) fires `push()` on any file event.
- **`ws_listener`** holds a WebSocket to `/ws` and fires `pull()` on every server
  `"changed"` push — plus once on (re)connect, to reconcile anything missed while
  it was disconnected. It reconnects on its own every 3s if the socket drops.

**v1 limitations** (documented in `sync.py`):

- **No pull-side delta** — pull re-downloads a differing file's blocks in full,
  with no local block reuse. (It *does* skip files whose local blocks already
  match the recipe.)
- **Last-writer-wins on conflict** — concurrent commits are now *detected* (the
  server's etag CAS returns `412`, so a blind overwrite is no longer possible), but
  they're *resolved* by having the loser retry and win. No conflict copies yet.

---

## Configuration

All config comes from a `.env` file (see `.env.example`). Secrets are **required**
(no defaults) so the app refuses to start without them.

```
MONGODB_URI, MONGODB_DB
S3_ENDPOINT_URL, S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID, S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, S3_REGION, S3_BUCKET
S3_URL_TTL_SECONDS=300            # optional — presigned-URL lifetime; also the
                                  #   revocation window. Raise for slow, large downloads.
JWT_SECRET                        # required; generate: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256               # optional
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60    # optional
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=10080 # optional (default 7 days) — refresh-token lifetime
SHARE_LINK_EXPIRE_MINUTES=10080   # optional (default 7 days) — public share-link lifetime
REDIS_URL                         # optional; set to enable multi-server realtime
                                  #   (Redis pub/sub). Unset = single-process in-memory bus.
```

> **macOS note:** MongoDB Atlas TLS requires `certifi` (`tlsCAFile=certifi.where()`),
> already wired in `dependencies.py`. The single `MongoClient` is shared by both
> repositories via a cached `_get_database()`.

## Running

### 1. Setup (once)

```bash
uv venv DropboxClone --python /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env            # then fill in real values (see Configuration)
```

### 2. Launch the server

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --log-config log_config.yaml   # serves on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

> **Multi-server (optional):** realtime works out of the box on one server via an
> in-process bus. To run multiple app servers, start Redis (`redis-server`) and
> set `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379` — `notify` then fans out across servers
> via Redis pub/sub instead of staying local.

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs** for the interactive Swagger UI. Create an
account there (or via `curl`) before running the client:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username": "alice", "password": "secret123"}'
```

### 3. Launch the sync client

With the server running and the venv active, point the client at a local folder:

```bash
python -m client \
    --server   http://127.0.0.1:8000 \
    --username alice --password secret123 \
    --folder   ~/DropboxClone
```

The client logs in, does an initial two-way sync, then **watches the folder** and
pushes changes as they happen — while a WebSocket to `/ws` pulls remote updates
the moment another device commits. Drop a file into `~/DropboxClone` and it uploads;
run a second client against a different folder (or machine) with the same account
and it appears there, without polling.

```bash
# one-shot sync instead of continuous watching:
python -m client --server http://127.0.0.1:8000 \
    --username alice --password secret123 --folder ~/DropboxClone --once
```

| Flag                        | Default                 | Meaning                                   |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `--server`                  | `http://127.0.0.1:8000` | server base URL                           |
| `--username` / `--password` | *(required)*            | account to log in as (must already exist) |
| `--folder`                  | *(required)*            | local folder to sync                      |
| `--once`                    | off                     | sync once and exit (no watching)          |

### 4. Launch the web UI (optional)

A React + Vite single-page app in `frontend/` gives you a browser client with
the same delta engine as the Python client — chunking, dedup, and hash
verification all run in the browser, and block bytes go **browser → B2 directly**
via presigned URLs. It covers:

- **Auth** — register / login / logout (JWT held in memory).
- **Your files** — list, upload (block-level dedup), download (on-read hash
  verify), delete.
- **Shared with you** — a second tab: incoming grants (`/shares/incoming`), with
  hash-verified download from the owner's `<owner>/<hash>` namespace.
- **Sharing** — an expandable per-file panel: grant read-only access to another
  user, see **who the file is currently shared with** (`/shares/outgoing`) and
  revoke any of them, plus mint / copy / revoke public share-links.
- **Public links** — a no-auth `/?token=…` page that resolves a share-link and
  downloads the file (hash-verified) with no account.
- **Real-time** — both tabs hold a WebSocket (`/ws`), as does an open sharing panel.
  "Your files" refreshes when the same account commits or deletes elsewhere;
  "Shared with you" refreshes when someone grants, revokes, or deletes a file shared
  with you; the sharing panel refreshes when you grant, revoke, or mint a link from
  another device. A **commit** notifies only the owner — a recipient's list shows
  grants, not file contents, so a new version changes nothing they can see.

> **Dropped sockets** — sleep, proxy idle-timeout, redeploy — reconnect with
> exponential backoff (1s → 30s, jittered so a redeploy doesn't stampede every
> client at once). Nothing replays the notifications missed while away, so a
> successful *re*connect refetches. The socket stays an accelerator, not a
> dependency: every action also refreshes explicitly, so a wedged socket degrades
> the UI rather than corrupting it. (Why a socket and not SSE:
> [above](#why-websockets--and-why-sse-was-the-closer-call).)

> The download path — fetch each block, re-verify `sha256(block) == hash`,
> reassemble — lives once in `frontend/src/lib/download.ts` (`assembleBlocks`), shared
> by all three of the owned-file, shared-file, and public-link flows.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install                     # once
npm run dev                     # serves on http://localhost:5173
```

Keep the API server (step 2) running in another terminal. Vite proxies the API
routes (`/auth`, `/files`, `/blocks`, `/shares`, `/link`, `/ws`) to
`http://127.0.0.1:8000`, so there's no CORS setup for local dev. Open
**http://localhost:5173** and register or log in.

> Because the browser PUTs/GETs block bytes straight to B2, the bucket needs a
> CORS rule allowing your dev origin (`http://localhost:5173`) for `GET`, `PUT`,
> and `HEAD`. Add your production origin to that rule when you deploy.

| Script            | What it does                                       |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `npm run dev`     | dev server with hot-reload on `:5173`              |
| `npm run build`   | type-check (`tsc`) then bundle to `frontend/dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | serve the production build locally                 |

## Demo: the whole system via `curl`

With the server running (and `jq` installed), this walks through upload →
share → read-as-another-user → public link → revoke-link → revoke-grant. It
uses a small single-block file, so the block hash is just `sha256(file)`.

```bash
BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8000

# 1. Two accounts

## Testing

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest                          # runs with coverage; fails under 90%
```

Tests mirror the `app/` and `client/` trees. External services (B2, Mongo) and
HTTP are mocked or faked, so the suite runs offline and deterministically.

## Scaling

A note on what it would take to run this for **large files** and **many users**.
The short version: the *data plane* already scales, because content addressing +
presigned direct-to-B2 transfer means **file bytes never touch the app server**.
The work is almost all in the *control plane*.

### Large files

Two things are already right:

- **Bytes bypass the app server** — block data goes browser/client → B2 directly;
  the API only moves tiny JSON.
- **Identical blocks transfer once** — dedup, within a user's namespace.

What starts to hurt:

- **Unbounded fan-out.** A 50 GB file is ~12,000 blocks — today that's one giant
  `upload-urls` response and (in the web client) 12,000 concurrent `PUT`s. Bound
  the in-flight concurrency to a small pool (~6–10) and mint presigned URLs in
  **batches** as the pool drains, rather than all at once.
- **No resumability.** A dropped connection restarts the transfer. Content
  addressing softens this (already-committed blocks are skipped by
  `/blocks/missing`), but large blocks want **S3 multipart upload**, and the
  client wants to **checkpoint** progress.
- **Fixed-size chunking defeats dedup on edits.** Inserting one byte at the front
  shifts every 4 MiB boundary, so every block hash changes. **Content-defined
  chunking** (rolling hash, à la restic/borg) is the fix — the `chunker.split()`
  seam is already isolated for exactly this swap.
- **Whole-file reassembly in memory.** The download path collects every block into
  one `Blob`/buffer — a huge file OOMs the tab or process. **Stream** to disk as
  blocks arrive (File System Access API / a `ReadableStream`) instead.

### Many users

Here the bottlenecks move to the app tier, Mongo, and the real-time layer:

- **Cross-server realtime fan-out — done.** This *was* the first thing to break
  on horizontal scale: `realtime.ConnectionManager` holds sockets in-process, so a
  commit on instance A couldn't notify a socket on instance B. It's now solved by
  the **`ChangeBus`** — `notify` publishes to Redis pub/sub and every server fans
  out `{"type":"changed"}` to its own sockets (see the Architecture "Realtime
  path"). Sticky WebSocket sessions are no longer needed. Falls back to an
  in-process bus when `REDIS_URL` is unset. What's left here is *tuning*, not
  architecture: per-user channels instead of one global channel if publish volume
  ever gets hot.
- **The app tier is nearly stateless already.** Auth is a stateless JWT and bytes
  bypass the app, so FastAPI instances scale horizontally behind a load balancer
  with autoscaling — and with the pub/sub bus shipped, that's now fully true.
- **Mongo indexing & sharding.** Every hot query is indexed — `files` on
  `(owner, path)` unique; `shares` on `(owner, path, shared_with)` unique (whose
  leftmost prefix also serves the `(owner, path)` purge) plus `shared_with` alone
  for the recipient's list; `share_links` on `jti` unique, `(owner, path)`, and a
  TTL on `expires_at`; `blocks` on `(owner, hash)` unique (the block index — a single
  `$in` lookup answers negotiation, replacing one B2 `HEAD` per hash). At very large
  scale, **shard on `owner`** so a user's files and blocks colocate.
- **CDN in front of B2.** Cache public-link downloads at the edge instead of
  re-fetching per request; presigned GETs work behind a CDN.
- **Garbage collection that scales.** Now that file delete ships, orphaned blocks
  are real. The one-shot full-scan audit (`scripts/audit_storage.py` — phantom
  files, orphaned blocks, orphaned grants) is fine at this size but won't scale —
  the endgame is **per-block reference counting** or an incremental mark-and-sweep,
  not a full bucket + collection scan.

The highest-leverage step — the **Redis pub/sub bus** behind `ConnectionManager`,
which unlocks running more than one server at all — is **done**. With the app tier
now horizontally scalable, the next control-plane investments are **Mongo indexing
& sharding** and **reference-counted GC**, both of which matter only as data
volume grows.

## Status & roadmap

**Done:**

- **Core storage** — content-addressed blocks, chunking/dedup, REST API, JWT auth,
  ports & adapters throughout.
- **Delta sync** — client-side chunking, have/need negotiation, presigned
  direct-to-B2 transfer, per-user block scoping, re-verify-on-read.
- **Sync client** — folder watcher, push/pull, WebSocket-driven pull.
- **Real-time** — `ChangeBus` over Redis pub/sub, so a commit on one server reaches
  a device on another. Each route notifies exactly the users whose view changed.
  The client socket reconnects with jittered exponential backoff and refetches on reopen.
- **Sharing** — user-to-user grants and public share-links, both revocable, links
  also expiring. Authorization never touches storage. Revocation closes the read
  window in 5 minutes (`s3_url_ttl_seconds`), bounded below by download speed.
- **File deletion** — owner-scoped, cascades to grants and links before the recipe.
- **Optimistic concurrency** — every file carries an `etag = sha256(recipe)`; `commit`
  is an `If-Match`/`If-None-Match` conditional write (single-doc CAS), so concurrent
  writers get `412` instead of silently clobbering. Both clients send the precondition
  and reconcile on conflict; identical re-commits fold into a no-op.
- **Block index** — a Mongo `(owner, hash)` collection (`BlockIndex` port) makes
  `/blocks/missing` a single `$in` query instead of one B2 `HEAD` per hash; `commit`
  verifies only not-yet-indexed blocks in B2, keeping the index a strict subset of B2.
- **Refresh tokens** — `jti` allowlist with TTL reap; `typ`-guarded against
  cross-use; the web session survives reload and auto-refreshes on a 401.
- **Web UI** — React + Vite: tabbed "Your files" / "Shared with you", upload,
  hash-verified download, delete, full sharing, no-auth public download page.
- **Indexes** — unique on `username`, `jti`, `(owner, path)`, the grant triple, and
  `(owner, hash)` (block index); TTL reap on expiring `refresh_tokens` and `share_links`.
- **100% backend coverage**, plus frontend unit tests.

**Next:**

- Content-defined chunking (so delta survives insertions). Fixed 4 MiB offsets mean
  a one-byte insertion at the front rewrites every block hash.
- Pull-side delta (reuse local blocks instead of re-downloading a changed file) —
  worth little until chunking is content-defined, since today an insert invalidates
  every block anyway.
- Streaming chunking for very large files (avoid reading whole file into memory).
- Orphaned-block garbage collection — now unlocked, since delete is the first
  operation that creates real orphans. `scripts/audit_storage.py` is the cleanup
  path (it already reaps orphaned grants too); a scheduled mark-and-sweep GC
  finally has a use case.

**Hardening backlog:**

- Conflict copies (concurrent writes are now *detected* via the etag CAS → `412`;
  resolution is still last-writer-wins — the richer step is writing the loser's
  version alongside the winner's instead of retrying over it). File versioning
  (keeping prior recipes) is the natural extension.
- **Auth hardening.** Deferred as operational/feature security, not architecture —
  the auth *model* (stateless JWT + bcrypt + a `jti`-allowlisted refresh token) is in
  place; these are policy knobs layered on top:
    - **Access-token revocation** — the access JWT is stateless, so logout kills only
      the refresh `jti`; a stolen access token stays valid to its `exp` (60 min). The
      fix trades a little statelessness for a check — a short-TTL denylist of revoked
      `jti`s (Redis), or shrinking the access-token lifetime toward the refresh cadence.
    - **Refresh-token rotation** — refresh tokens are non-rotating, so a stolen one is
      reusable for its whole 7-day life with no theft signal. Rotation mints a fresh
      `jti` per refresh and retires the old; a *reused* retired `jti` flags a compromise.
    - **httpOnly-cookie storage** — the web client keeps tokens in `localStorage`
      (XSS-readable); `httpOnly` cookies remove that surface, at the cost of adding CSRF
      defenses.
    - **Login rate-limiting** — `/auth/login` has no throttle or lockout; bcrypt slows a
      single guess but nothing caps attempt *volume* (credential stuffing). The fix is a
      per-IP / per-account limiter — a Redis token bucket (the pub/sub Redis is already
      wired) plus optional backoff/lockout.
- **Resource limits & quotas.** There's no cap on what a client can ask for or
  store — deliberately deferred as abuse-hardening / product policy, not core
  architecture (the data plane already scales; bytes bypass the app server). Three
  independent, well-understood knobs, none in place:
    - **Request shape** — `BlockHashesRequest.hashes` and `CommitFileRequest.block_hashes`
      have no length bound, so a giant `hashes` list is an amplification vector (one
      request → *N* B2 HEADs, or an unbounded Mongo recipe doc). Closable at the
      validation boundary with a Pydantic `Field(max_length=…)` → automatic `422`.
    - **Bytes per upload** — the presigned **PUT** carries no size limit, so a client
      can PUT arbitrary bytes (and never commit, orphaning them). The real fix is a
      presigned **POST** with a `content-length-range` policy S3 enforces — pending
      confirmation that B2's S3 API honors POST Object; otherwise a sweep in
      `scripts/audit_storage.py` reaps over-size/orphaned blocks after the fact.
    - **Per-user storage quota** — no running per-owner byte total, so nothing rejects
      the *N*-th GB. Needs a counter keyed on `owner` (logical sum of file sizes is the
      cheap first cut; physical/deduped needs per-block reference counting).
